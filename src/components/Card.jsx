          <h3>Camping in Western Australia</h3>
          <p>
            The Australian West coast is a camperâ€™s heaven. 
            Endless miles of desert roads leading to secret beaches, 
            vast canyons and crystal clear rivers, and the very few people you 
            are likely to meet on your journey will be some of the most easy-going 
            characters you will find anywhere in the world.
